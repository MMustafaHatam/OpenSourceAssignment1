Open Source First Assignment with three files 


a. How you handled setting variables and the default values. 

I created around eight variables then I setted the data types for it. Finally then prompted them with echo command to show the task of each variable to the user. 




b. How your script should be executed. 

You should have either a linux Ubuntu OS or install a virtual box after that run the Ubuntu image and then go to the terminal and typel ./gradingSystem.sh then press enter and the grading system will run then.




c. How you handled the VERBOSE variable.
I check every variable separately for verbose, by making others as a coment and run just the one which i wanted to debug, and when everything was sorted, then I run others gradually step by step. This verbose mode is a choice accessible in numerous PC working frameworks, including Linux that gives extra points of interest with respect to what the Personal Computers are doing with the script and what drivers and programming it is.



 
d. How you terminated the program early if the compilation command failed. 

You can do it with Crtl + C which will terminate the program.  And with Ctrl + Z you can stop it as well. Finally, if you want don't want to enter data in any field then simply press ctrl + D which will bypass for example gender or any other field you wish, or even you escape all the fields then the result will appear an F. 



e. How you get the input from the user  

By Keyboard alphabetical characters to enter names, and gender, and number keys to enter ID number and grades in to the same. 

 

f. How you handle the input of different data type (e.g., integer, string, etc) 

I created an if function for name to only accept characters not numbers, and as well for the ID nUMBER i create the opposite of the name function to only accept numbers not alphabets.In addition, to control the grading that for example the assignment field should not accept more than 20, there i create a while loop to only accept less than 20 and more than 0, as well for other fields of grading entry. 



g. How to add more records to the same file 

very easy just keep running the file to add more records. when you go to the terminal type ./gradingSystem and then press enter for a record, as many times as you run, you can add more records to the output file.
